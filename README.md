# About this project
Since machine-actionable Data Management Plans are becoming more and more common, there are also increased benefits not only for researchers, but also for funders. In this project we aim to extend the current defined constraints in order to support even more funding related constraints. This is done with the help of rewritten SPARQL queries into SHACL.

## Validation of maDMPs with SHACL
This project should replace the existing SPARQL validation queries with the newer SHACL ones. Since SPARQL is to some extent verbose and error prone, we used SHACL for validation.

## Base of this project
The base of this project were the already existing SPARQL queries writen by [raffaelfoidl](https://github.com/raffaelfoidl/maDMP-evaluation/tree/v1.2).
